            Establishing a solid foundation for your product is of uttermost

            depending on your target audience, for example: is it going to be a
            native app or a web app? But also where to look for ideas, passive
            vs. active learning, and, if educational, what subjects work best.

            Gamification is not just a layer you place on top of the experience

            beginning. But what does constitute an effective gamification? What
            are the ingredients at our disposal and how can we make the best out

            establish a empathic connection with them, while, at the same time,
            providing a neutral feedback to their observations to avoid swaying
